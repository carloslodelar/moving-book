# Protocol parameters



We can think of the protocol parameters as the set of rules that govern the Cardano.

Let's explore the protocol parameters with the Cardano-CLI. Note that we will use mainnet this time as testnets might have different values on the parameters. Also note that we are simplifying the out by colapsing the cost models.&#x20;

```
$ cardano-cli query protocol-parameters --mainnet

> {
    "collateralPercentage": 150,
    "costModels": {
        "PlutusScriptV1": {...},
        "PlutusScriptV2": {...}
    },
    "decentralization": null,
    "executionUnitPrices": {
        "priceMemory": 5.77e-2,
        "priceSteps": 7.21e-5
    },
    "extraPraosEntropy": null,
    "maxBlockBodySize": 90112,
    "maxBlockExecutionUnits": {
        "memory": 62000000,
        "steps": 40000000000
    },
    "maxBlockHeaderSize": 1100,
    "maxCollateralInputs": 3,
    "maxTxExecutionUnits": {
        "memory": 14000000,
        "steps": 10000000000
    },
    "maxTxSize": 16384, 
    "maxValueSize": 5000,
    "minPoolCost": 340000000,
    "minUTxOValue": null,
    "monetaryExpansion": 3.0e-3,
    "poolPledgeInfluence": 0.3,
    "poolRetireMaxEpoch": 18,
    "protocolVersion": {
        "major": 7,
        "minor": 0
    },
    "stakeAddressDeposit": 2000000,
    "stakePoolDeposit": 500000000,
    "stakePoolTargetNum": 500,
    "treasuryCut": 0.2,
    "txFeeFixed": 155381,
    "txFeePerByte": 44,
    "utxoCostPerByte": 4310,
    "utxoCostPerWord": null
}
```

So, the CLI is getting the protocol parameters from the Ledger state, this means that these are the currently active parameters and their active values. Note that those that are set to null are parameters that have been deprecated.&#x20;

Protocol parameters can be updated, via an update proposal.&#x20;

In addition to **protocol parameters** we have **global constants**. Unlike protocol parameters, global constants can only be updated with a software update which always include increasing the protocol version. An increase in the major version indicates a hard fork, and the minor version a soft fork (meaning old software can validate but not produce new blocks).&#x20;

```
SlotsPerEpoch
SlotsPerKESPeriod
MaxKESEvolutions
StabilityWindow
RandomnessStabilisationWindow
Quorum
MaxMajorPV
ActiveSlotCoeff
NetworkId
MaxLovelaceSupply
securityParam
slotLength
```

Below you will find a description of the protocol parameters and global constants:
